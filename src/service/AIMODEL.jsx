Check current rates before booking *anything*.\n*   **Transportation:**  Walking is great, but the Strip is long.  Consider using the Las Vegas Monorail, the Deuce bus, or ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft).  Free trams connect some casinos.\n*   **Food:**  Look for affordable dining options off the Strip or downtown.  Fast food, food courts, and buffets can be budget-friendly.  Consider a picnic lunch one day.\n*   **Drinks:**  Alcohol is expensive in Vegas.  Happy hour deals are your friend.  Consider buying some drinks at a local store to have in your hotel room.\n*   **Gambling:** Set a budget for gambling and stick to it.\n*   **Flexibility:**  This is just a suggestion.  Feel free to customize the itinerary based on your interests and budget.\n*   **Discounts:** Check websites like Groupon and Vegas.com for discounts on shows and attractions.\n*   **Hotel Fees:** Always check the \"resort fees\" before booking a hotel. These can add a significant amount to the total cost.\n\n**How to Use the JSON:**\n\n*   This JSON data can be parsed and used by a program or application to display the itinerary, hotel options, and other information in a user-friendly format.  You can use any programming language with JSON parsing capabilities (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).\n*   You can also copy and paste the JSON into an online JSON viewer or editor to format it for readability.\n*   You can modify the values (prices, ratings, etc.) to reflect current information or your personal preferences.\n\nEnjoy your budget-friendly trip to Las Vegas!\n"},
